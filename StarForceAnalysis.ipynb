    "As a data scientist, you'll not only be analysing, but assembling data into larger datasets. While you could add individual rows to a table, its more common to add many rows, or even create a new table from a large file. Comma separated variable (CSV) files are simply text with the column entries in each row separated by a comma. Other separators can be used instead, but let's stick with commas. \n",
    "There is an abundance of data on the internet, but let's make some ourselves. We will create data to populate some fields in two CSV files. Let's imagine that we work for Star Force (I was going to use \"Space Force\" until I learned there is already an organization called that. Can you believe that?). Star Force command suspects that its best starship pilots, the ones who have accumulated the highest scores, are teamed with the best engineers. Engineers are shipmates who aid in all manner of starship systems control and maintenance. Command has asked you, a newly assigned analyst, to confirm their belief; they have asked you to identify the engineers teamed with the highest performing pilots, say with scores above 0.85.\n",
    "First, let's create two CSV files: pilots.csv and engineers.csv. Then we create a database and insert the pilots data into one table, and insert the engineers data into the other."
