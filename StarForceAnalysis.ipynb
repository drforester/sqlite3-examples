    "### Practice SQL queries with Python and sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "You are using databases all the time, though you might not realize it. Even if you have never even queried a table, you almost certainly own a device which runs applications that use a lightweight database engine. By far the most widely used database engine is [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html). It is so nearly ubiquitous that almost every mobile phone and web browser use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you a Python programmer, but not really proficient in SQL? You're in luck, because Python, adhering to it's philosophy of \"batteries included\", has [support for SQLite built-in](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)!\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ah, but wait\", I hear you saying, \"does SQLite use the standard SQL languge?\" The answer is yes..., well mostly anyway. \"SQLite understands most of the standard SQL language. But it does omit some features while at the same time adding a few features of its own.\" If interested, read [SQL As Understood By SQLite](https://sqlite.org/lang.html). In short, if you learn SQL using SQLite, then you will be able to interact with most any other database engine that supports standard SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we'll go through some practical exercises with a simple dataset. I'll assume that the reader has intermediate Python skill but has little knowledge of SQL. We'll see how to create a database from a CSV file, and then how to add another table. We'll learn how to do queries, from simple ones to more complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using sqlite3 from Python liberates me from the pain of setting-up and maintaining a client/server SQL database engine such as MySQL, or PostgreSQL. SQLite has a command-line interface, however since most data scientists will want to do further analysis on their query results, it makes sense to learn it from within the context of the Python interpreter. Whether you are just learning SQL and want to practice for that Data Scientist interview, or whether you have SQL experience and just want to see if sqlite3 has what you require, I hope you'll find these examples helpful."

    "As a data scientist, you'll not only be analysing, but assembling data into larger datasets. While you could add individual rows to a table, its more common to add many rows, or even create a new table from a large file. Comma separated variable (CSV) files are simply text with the column entries in each row separated by a comma. Other separators can be used instead, but let's stick with commas. \n",
    "There is an abundance of data on the internet, but let's make some ourselves. We will create data to populate some fields in two CSV files. Let's imagine that we work for Star Force (I was going to use \"Space Force\" until I learned there is already an organization called that. WTF, can you believe that?). Star Force command suspects that its best starship pilots, the ones who have accumulated the highest scores, are teamed with the best engineers. Engineers are shipmates who aid in all manner of starship systems control and maintenance. Command has asked you, a newly assigned analyst, to confirm their belief; they have asked you to identify the engineers teamed with the highest performing pilots, say with scores above 0.85.\n",
    "First, let's we create two CSV files, one named pilots.csv and another named engineers.csv. Then we create a database and insert the pilots data into one table, and insert the engineers data into another."
